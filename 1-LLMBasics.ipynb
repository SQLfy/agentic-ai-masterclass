      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Check the Weather Forecast\n",
      "- You can use reliable weather websites like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or a weather app on your smartphone. Simply enter \"Miami, Florida\" and look for the forecast for next week. Pay attention to factors like temperature, precipitation, and wind speed to find the best days for your trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Identify the Best 3-Day Window\n",
      "- Look for days with the best weather conditions – generally, this means mild temperatures (not too hot), little to no chance of rain, and calm winds. Typically, mid-week days might be less crowded and may offer better rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Book Round-Trip Flights\n",
      "- Once you have chosen your dates, head to popular flight booking websites like Expedia, Kayak, Google Flights, or directly to airlines' websites (like Delta, American Airlines, etc.).\n",
      "- Input your departure city (New York), destination (Miami), and the selected travel dates for a round trip. Compare prices and choose the best option that fits your budget and schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Confirm Booking Details\n",
      "- After selecting your flight, carefully review the booking summary that includes the dates, airline, flight times, and total price before finalizing. Make sure to enter your personal and payment information securely.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alternative Solutions:\n",
