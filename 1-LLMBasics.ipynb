      "\n",
      "1. **Check the Weather Forecast:**\n",
      "   - Use a reliable weather website or app (like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or your local meteorological service).\n",
      "   - Search for Miami, Florida, and check the forecast for the next week.\n",
      "   - Look for a 3-day window with clear skies, mild temperatures, and no significant precipitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Choose the Best 3-Day Window:**\n",
      "   - After checking the forecast, determine which days have the best overall weather conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Book Flight Tickets:**\n",
      "   - Visit a travel booking website (such as Expedia, Google Flights, or a specific airline's website).\n",
      "   - Input the round-trip details: departure city (New York), destination (Miami), and the preferred travel dates based on your weather checks.\n",
      "   - Compare flight options based on airlines, times, and prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Confirm Booking Details:**\n",
      "   - Once you select a flight, follow the prompts to enter passenger details and payment information.\n",
      "   - After booking, you should receive a confirmation with all flight details like dates, airline, flight times, and price.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Tips:\n",
      "- Always check for any restrictions or changes in flight schedules.\n",
      "- Consider travel insurance for added protection.\n",
      "- Look out for any hidden fees during the booking process.\n",
      "\n",
